# Python_lectures
Here is all lecture files of Python that I have studied from Pierian Data, Udemy.
There are 2 most important files which is Tic Tac Toe [2].ipynb which is the first milestone project that involved about how to use Python function and its basic data structure to create Tic Tac Toe game. The other, Text-based Blackjack.ipynb. which is more complex than the first milestone project. That major is to use the Python OOP and functions to create blackjack game.
